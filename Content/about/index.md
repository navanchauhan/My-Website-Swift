# About Me

Hi! My name is Navan Chauhan. 


![](/images/me.jpeg)


### What do I like?

* In my free time I like restoring and colourising (YES, I follow British English) photographs. [My Behance Profile](https://www.behance.net/gallery/73508827/Restorations-and-Colourisation)

* I also like automating the mundane stuff using Python, and I have started dabbling in Swift.

* I love creating weird machine learning models using Tensorflow ( I personally preffer Turicreate tbh )
